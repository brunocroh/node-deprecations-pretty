## Description

This codemod should remove HTTP/2 priority-related options and methods since priority signaling has been deprecated. It's useful to migrate code that uses deprecated HTTP/2 priority features.

It should remove HTTP/2 priority-related options and methods. It should handle priority parameters in HTTP/2 stream creation. It should remove weight and dependency settings in HTTP/2 streams. It should handle both CommonJS and ESM imports.

## Examples

Case 1

Before:

```js
const http2 = require("node:http2");
const session = http2.connect("https://example.com", {
  priority: {
    weight: 16,
    parent: 0,
    exclusive: false
  }
});
```

After:

```js
const http2 = require("node:http2");
const session = http2.connect("https://example.com");
```

Case 2

Before:

```js
const http2 = require("node:http2");
const stream = session.request({
  ":path": "/api/data",
  priority: { weight: 32 }
});
```

After:

```js
const http2 = require("node:http2");
const stream = session.request({
  ":path": "/api/data"
});
```

Case 3

Before:

```js
const http2 = require("node:http2");
stream.priority({
  exclusive: true,
  parent: 0,
  weight: 128
});
```

After:

```js
const http2 = require("node:http2");
// Priority signaling removed - no replacement needed
```

Case 4

Before:

```js
import http2 from "node:http2";
const client = http2.connect("https://example.com");
client.settings({ enablePush: false, priority: true });
```

After:

```js
import http2 from "node:http2";
const client = http2.connect("https://example.com");
client.settings({ enablePush: false });
```
