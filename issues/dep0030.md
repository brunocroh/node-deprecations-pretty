# SlowBuffer

## Description

Since `SlowBuffer` is deprecated (DEP0030) and has reached Runtime status, we should provide a codemod to replace it.

- The codemod should replace `new SlowBuffer(size)` with `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(size)`.
- The codemod should handle both CommonJS and ESM imports.
- The codemod should preserve any comments and variable assignments.

## Additional Information

Note that `SlowBuffer` was deprecated in Node.js v6.0.0. The class was deprecated because it allocated memory outside the main Buffer pool and could be slower for performance. Instead of `SlowBuffer`, developers should use `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()`.

The `SlowBuffer` class created Buffer instances that were not pooled with the main Buffer pool, which could lead to memory fragmentation and performance issues.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic SlowBuffer creation

**Before:**

```js
const buf = new SlowBuffer(1024);
```

**After:**

```js
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(1024);
```

### Example 2: SlowBuffer with variable assignment

**Before:**

```js
const size = 512;
const buffer = new SlowBuffer(size);
```

**After:**

```js
const size = 512;
const buffer = Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(size);
```

### Example 3: SlowBuffer in function

**Before:**

```js
function createBuffer(length) {
  return new SlowBuffer(length);
}
```

**After:**

```js
function createBuffer(length) {
  return Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(length);
}
```

### Example 4: SlowBuffer with immediate usage

**Before:**

```js
const data = new SlowBuffer(8);
data.writeDoubleLE(3.14, 0);
```

**After:**

```js
const data = Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(8);
data.writeDoubleLE(3.14, 0);
```
