# Instantiating node:http classes without new

## Description

Since instantiating `node:http` classes without `new` is deprecated (DEP0195) and has reached Documentation-only status, we should provide a codemod to replace it.

- The codemod should add `new` keyword when instantiating http classes without it.
- The codemod should handle all http classes: `OutgoingMessage`, `IncomingMessage`, `ServerResponse`, and `ClientRequest`.
- The codemod should handle both CommonJS and ESM imports.
- The codemod should preserve any constructor arguments and assignments.

## Additional Information

Note that instantiating classes without the `new` qualifier exported by the `node:http` module was deprecated in Node.js v24.2.0. The deprecation was introduced because calling class constructors without `new` can lead to unexpected behavior and is not consistent with standard JavaScript class instantiation patterns. Instead of calling constructors directly, developers should use the `new` keyword when instantiating http classes.

The affected classes include `OutgoingMessage`, `IncomingMessage`, `ServerResponse`, and `ClientRequest`, which are foundational classes for HTTP communication in Node.js.

## Examples

### Example 1: OutgoingMessage instantiation

**Before:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const message = http.OutgoingMessage();
```

**After:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const message = new http.OutgoingMessage();
```

### Example 2: IncomingMessage instantiation

**Before:**

```js
const { IncomingMessage } = require("node:http");
const incoming = IncomingMessage(socket);
```

**After:**

```js
const { IncomingMessage } = require("node:http");
const incoming = new IncomingMessage(socket);
```

### Example 3: ServerResponse instantiation

**Before:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const response = http.ServerResponse(request);
```

**After:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const response = new http.ServerResponse(request);
```

### Example 4: ClientRequest instantiation

**Before:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const request = http.ClientRequest(options);
```

**After:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const request = new http.ClientRequest(options);
```

### Example 5: ESM import usage

**Before:**

```js
import { OutgoingMessage } from "node:http";
const message = OutgoingMessage();
```

**After:**

```js
import { OutgoingMessage } from "node:http";
const message = new OutgoingMessage();
```

### Example 6: Multiple classes in one file

**Before:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const message = http.OutgoingMessage();
const request = http.ClientRequest({ method: "GET" });
```

**After:**

```js
const http = require("node:http");
const message = new http.OutgoingMessage();
const request = new http.ClientRequest({ method: "GET" });
```
